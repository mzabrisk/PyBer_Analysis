# PyBer Analysis

## Overview




## Results

In general, when looking at the PyBer summary DataFrame, the summed or counted data (Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares) are greatest in Urban Areas, and least in Rural areas. The averaged data (Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver) are greatest in the Rural areas and smallest in Urban areas. The complete data can be see




## Summary

In short, further analysis is needed in order to make any major conclusions from the data.

- The number of drivers in Urban areas exceeds the ride demand. This leads to a low value for average fare/driver. A couple of potential solutions:
    - If the potential for more demand is there, more money needs to be spent on advertising/marketing in Urban areas to increase the number of riders to match the ride supply (drivers).
    - If the market seems to be completely tapped, it may be time to reduce the number of drivers in the Urban areas, thus increasing the average fare/driver, and keeping the drivers happier.

- On the surface it appears that there might be more potential in the Rural market since the total fares is significantly less than either Urban or Suburban.

- a study needs to be conducted to determine whether the is potential for greater demand in the rural areas. If there is, it also needs to be determined whether or not there is potential for more supply (either more drivers, or more rides given by each current driver). If there is potential for both, efforts should be made to increase both. If
